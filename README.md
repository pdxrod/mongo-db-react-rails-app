# MONGODB-REACT-RAILS-APP: A Simple Rails Crud App With React and MongoDB

I took https://medium.com/quick-code/simple-rails-crud-app-with-react-frontend-using-react-rails-gem-b708b89a9419

https://github.com/nothingisfunny/fruits-crud-react-rails-app

and found it was the best simple introduction to React I've seen, so I cloned it, then replaced SQL with MongoDB.
